# Memory_Hierarchy_Simulator
Coded a trace-driven WBWA L1/L2 cache simulator in C++ with LRU replacement; evaluated performance using spec-style traces. Simulated 55+ cache configurations to study miss rate and AAT trends across size, associativity, and block size, and implemented stream-buffer prefetching to exploit spatial locality.
